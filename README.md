Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. The software that they wanted me to design was a software called Draw It or Lose it, which is a web-based game that initially they released on android. This software imitates a popular tv show called Win, Lose or Draw. I was mainly tasked with getting their game on multiple platforms and recommending servers to allow clients to play their game cross platform.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did particularly well in all parts of the documentation, but mainly the Development Requirements as I was very detailed with each platform.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
When working through a design document, This directly helped with developing the code because spotting the solutions basically came from the document, which was very helpfulafter implementing the code.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 
If I could revise anything, it would be the comments. I believe I just jotted down what I believe I did for each comment in under a sentence. I do believe that comments doesn't need to take much time but comments are you chance to not be as serious.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 
I did interpret the user's needs and implemented them into the software design. I believe this is important because if you don't solve what the user's needs then when it comes to it, the user will end up having more problems than what they started with, and I would not have done my job properly.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
The approach designing software for me that I take is usually kind of incremental, where I go over everything multiple times to see where I could add more to it later. This is probably my favorite strategy and I was do the similar thing in the future because It allows me to build up on the basics until the software or design is fully fleshed out.
